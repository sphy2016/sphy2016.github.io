## Hey there, this is shuairu.

I am Shuairu Zhu (朱帅儒), a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SHAO, CAS), advised by Dr. Zhenya Zheng. I received my B.S. from Central China Normal University (CCNU) in 2015. I study galaxies in early Universe, especially those that emit hydrogen-ionizing (Lyman-continuum, LyC) photons, to understand cosmic reionization and the evolution of the Universe.
